Introduction


I made a site for small business/event owners who can advertise their business or their event and anyone can see the businesses that are on the site.
The users can mark their favorite cards, see their cards, add, edit and delete a card (all this according to the user's permissions).
The user can also edit their profile as needed.
The site administrator can delete users and change the user's status.
