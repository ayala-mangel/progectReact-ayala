Introduction


I made a site for small business/event owners who can advertise their business or their event and anyone can see the businesses that are on the site.
The users can mark their favorite cards, see their cards, add, edit and delete a card (all this according to the user's permissions).
The user can also edit their profile as needed.
The site administrator can delete users and change the user's status.

Development Environment

Initial setup

To run a dev env the following libraries/applications need to be installed on your host:

react router dom

	npm i react-router-dom

Material-UI = https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

	npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
 
 Joy-UI = https://mui.com/joy-ui/getting-started/installation/

  	npm install @mui/joy @emotion/react @emotion/styled
